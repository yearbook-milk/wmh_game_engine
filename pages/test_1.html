<h1>Functions test page</h1>
>> goto [location] - opens page at /pages/[location].html

>> log [message] - logs a message in the console
>> alert [message] - prompts the user with an alert using an alert() call. This command blocks until the user acknowledges the alert.

>> sfx [url] - starts the sound effect at /sfx/[url].html and does not wait for it to finish. 
>> sfx-blocking [url] - does the same thing as sfx except it waits for the sound effect to finish before proceeding.

>> stop - intentionally causes an error
