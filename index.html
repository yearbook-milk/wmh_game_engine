Decision One Use of Artillery 

Your Lt. Col. (commanding officer) gave you no detailed directions. It is up to you to figure out how to take the bunker. Your first decision is how do you use artillery? Read each option and click on the one you choose. Additional information on video if you want..

You have a French advisor (picture below) who fought here in 1916.



These big guns are the true queens of the battlefield and killed more than even machine guns. These guns came in all sizes and also can fire poison gas as well as explosives.
  
              



You have three choices and some advice. Your American training and the recommendation of your French advisor would suggest that you use a massive 12 hour bombardment designed to obliterate the German lines and to use mustard and chlorine gas to kill as many Germans as possible. The problem is that this makes it clear where you will attack This is option 1




You could also decide to use a lot of guns for just a few minutes. This should cause problems and German losses in the front two trenches as well as cutting wire but not give Germans the chance to reinforce this position. This limited bombardment is option #2.





(More Below)
Your longest serving soldier who fought natives 30 years ago suggests not using artillery and to try to sneak across no mans land. This option 3.



Afro American troops primarily equipped with French gear and guns.
